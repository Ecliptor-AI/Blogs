**MINNEAPOLIS (August 21, 2024)** – Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) today announced its second quarter 2024 financial results, which reflected a return to topline growth and strong profit performance.

The Company reported second quarter GAAP and Adjusted earnings per share¹ (EPS) of $2.57, compared with $1.80 in 2023. The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.

---

¹Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items, when applicable. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.

"We made a commitment to get back to growth in the second quarter, and the team delivered, all while expanding operating margins and growing EPS by more than 40% compared to last year. Importantly, our growth was driven entirely by traffic in stores and our digital channels, with double-digit growth in our same-day delivery services," said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "We also saw improving trends across our discretionary categories, most notably in apparel, and we're seeing continued strength in beauty. Looking ahead, even as we maintain the measured outlook that has served us well, we are focused on building on this positive momentum by executing our strategy and providing the unique combination of newness and value that consumers can only find at Target."

## Guidance

For the third quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $2.10 to $2.40.

While the Company believes its full-year guidance range of a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales remains appropriate, it now believes the increase will more likely be in the lower half of that range. However, based on strong profit performance in the front half of the year, the Company now expects full-year GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $9.00 to $9.70, up from the prior range of $8.60 to $9.60.

## Operating Results

Comparable sales increased 2.0 percent in the second quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales increase of 0.7 percent and a comparable digital sales increase of 8.7 percent. Total revenue of $25.3 billion in the second quarter was 2.7 percent higher than last year, reflecting a total sales increase of 2.6 percent and a 10.8 percent increase in other revenue. Second quarter operating income of $1.6 billion was 36.6 percent higher than last year, driven by sales growth and a higher gross margin rate.

Second quarter operating income margin rate was 6.4 percent in 2024, compared with 4.8 percent in 2023. Second quarter gross margin rate was 28.9 percent, compared with 27.0 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher digital fulfillment and supply chain costs. Second quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.2 percent in 2024, compared with 20.9 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits, partially offset by disciplined cost management.

## Interest Expense and Taxes

The Company's second quarter 2024 net interest expense was $110 million, compared with $141 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.

Second quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.9 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 22.2 percent, reflecting higher pretax earnings and lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.

## Capital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital

The Company paid dividends of $509 million in the second quarter, compared with $499 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.

The Company repurchased $155 million of its shares in the second quarter, retiring 1.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $145.94. As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.5 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.

For the trailing twelve months through second quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 16.6 percent, compared with 13.7 percent for the trailing twelve months through second quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.

## Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To provide additional transparency, we disclose non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS). When applicable, this metric excludes certain discretely managed items. However, there are no adjustments to any GAAP earnings measure presented. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EPS differently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

#### Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS

| | Three Months Ended: August 1, 2023 | Three Months Ended: July 30, 2022 | Change | Six Months Ended: August 1, 2023 | Six Months Ended: July 30, 2022 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share | $ 2.57 | $ 1.80 | 42.4 % | $ 4.60 | $ 3.86 | 19.3 % |

#### Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS Guidance
(per share amounts)

| | Guidance: Q3 2023 | Guidance: Full Year 2023 |
|---|---|---|
| GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance | $2.10 - $2.40 | $9.00 - $9.70 |
| Estimated adjustments | — | — |
| Other<sup>(a)</sup> | — | — |
| Adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance | $2.10 - $2.40 | $9.00 - $9.70 |

<sup>(a)</sup> Third quarter and full-year GAAP EPS may include the impact of certain discrete items, which will be excluded in calculating Adjusted EPS. The guidance does not currently reflect any such discrete items. In the past, these items have included losses on the early retirement of debt and certain other items that are discretely managed.

Earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) and earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide meaningful information about our operational efficiency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, and, for EBITDA, capital investment. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is net earnings. EBIT and EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate EBIT and EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of the measures for comparisons with other companies.

We have also disclosed after-tax ROIC, which is a ratio based on GAAP information, with the exception of the add-back of operating lease interest to operating income. We believe this metric is useful in assessing the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

<sup>(a)</sup> Represents the add-back to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as finance leases. Calculated using the discount rate for each lease and recorded as a component of rent expense within SG&A. Operating lease interest is added back to Operating Income in the ROIC calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors.

<sup>(b)</sup> Calculated using the effective tax rates for continuing operations, which were 22.4% and 20.3% for the trailing twelve months ended August 3, 2024, and July 29, 2023, respectively. For the twelve months ended August 3, 2024, and July 29, 2023, includes tax effect of $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, related to EBIT, and $33 million and $20 million, respectively, related to operating lease interest.

<sup>(c)</sup> Total short-term and long-term operating lease liabilities included within Accrued and Other Current Liabilities and Noncurrent Operating Lease Liabilities, respectively.

<sup>(d)</sup> Average based on the invested capital at the end of the current period and the invested capital at the end of the comparable prior period.

<sup>(e)</sup> Average based on the invested capital at the end of the current period and the invested capital at the end of the comparable prior period.
