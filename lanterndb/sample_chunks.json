Examples of additional reasons to add or substitute:\n   - \"Inadequate down payment\"\n   - \"No deposit relationship with us\"\n5. Creditors should customize forms to accurately reflect their specific decision-making factors.\n6.

  "Fair Credit Act: Guidelines for Fair Credit Agreements\n\nKey points for creditors when providing reasons for adverse actions:\n\n1. Customize reason checklists: Add or substitute reasons commonly used by the creditor if not already present on sample forms.\n\n2. Accuracy in reason selection: Select reasons that accurately reflect the factors actually used in decision-making. For example:\n   - If only bank references are considered, state \"insufficient bank references\" instead of \"insufficient credit references\"\n   - If bank and other credit references are distinct factors, treat and disclose them separately\n\n3. Specificity in disclosures: Be specific about the actual factors considered. For instance:\n   - Use \"insufficient bank references\" instead of \"insufficient credit references\" if finance company references are disregarded\n   - State \"length of residence\" rather than elaborating on why it adversely affected the application\n\n4. Flexibility in form modification: Creditors should either:\n   - Add other relevant factors to the form, or\n   - Check \"other\" and include an appropriate explanation\n\n5. Concise explanations: Creditors need not describe how or why a factor adversely affected the application in detail\n\nThese guidelines ensure compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Board (FCRB) regulations and promote transparency in credit decision communications.",
